## this is my first project (will learn alot)

    using @export will send the variables to be altered on the side for an easy tweak

todo: learn how to move my model

log 2: added basic movement except for sprint and still need to fix the camera; removed redundent files and code.

todo: fix the camera and hopefully add UI or make it last.
